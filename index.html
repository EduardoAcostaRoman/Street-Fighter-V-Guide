                        same time to execute moves with effects that differ between characters.

                        character-specific action like a teleport or timed power-up. V-Triggers cost your entire
                        V-Gauge.

                        The V-Shift battle mechanic will help you get out of tough situations at the cost of one bar of
                        V-Gauge. When timed correctly, V-Shift can be executed at nearly any moment in a match, and will
                        make you fully invincible to attacks, throws, and projectiles for a short time. Perform V-Shift
                        by
                        pressing Hard Punch and Medium Kick at the same time. Follow up with V-Shift Break by pressing
                        Hard
                        Punch and Medium Kick again or by simply holding both attacks down after a successful V-Shift.
